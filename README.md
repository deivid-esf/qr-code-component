## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Media queries
###
First, I made a simple card, using just 'div', 'img', 'h3' and 'p'. This was my first project on the Frontend Mentor platform.

Of course, there are other ways to make this card, and it can be better, but this was the way i chose it, I hope you like it!
